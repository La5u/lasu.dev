### How Poor Ergonomics Reduces Your Productivity

![picture of correct sitting posture](posture.jpg)
Poor sitting posture reduces productivity, worsens posture, and causes musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS).

In one study, 67% of students had at least one musculoskeletal symptom. Research also reports a 30% to 66% drop in productivity due to poor ergonomics and incorrect sitting posture. And the best part is: it’s not that hard to fix.

Place your feet flat on the floor, and keep your knees at roughly a 90–110° angle. Your elbows should be around 90°, with your shoulders relaxed. The top edge of your monitor should be roughly at eye level, because your gaze naturally points slightly downward. There are online calculators to fine-tune the ideal desk and chair height.

It also helps to add simple exercises: chin tucks, shoulder blade squeezes, chest stretches, gentle standing back extensions, shoulder circles, and neck rotations. Even better: combine this with stretching, regular exercise, and frequent breaks.

Fixing your ergonomics is an easy way to improve both productivity and health.
